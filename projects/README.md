Example projects README for PGMcpp.

--------


## Contents

In this `projects/` sub-directory, you should find this README, an example C++ project
(`example.cpp`), and an example Python 3 project (`example.py`).

--------


## Use

### C++

To compile and run the example C++ project, you can simply

    make project

from the root directory for PGMcpp (of course, you will need to have built PGMcpp
first!). This will run the model defined in `example.cpp` and then write example results
to `projects/example_cpp/`.

### Python 3

To run the example Python 3 project, you can simply

    python(3) example.py

from `projects/` (of course, you will need to have working bindings first!). This will
run the model defined in `example.py` and then write example results
to `projects/example_py/`.
